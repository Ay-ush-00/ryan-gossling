            In 1993, twelve-year-old Gosling attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of the Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club. He was given a two-year contract as a mouseketeer and moved to Orlando, Florida. He appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were considered more talented. Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of his life.Fellow cast members included Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake. Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in them "this great sense of focus." He became particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second year of the show. Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for work reasons. Gosling has said that even though he and Timberlake talk infrequently, they are still supportive of each other.

            Aged 19, Gosling decided to move into "serious acting". He was dropped by his agent and initially found it difficult to secure work because of the "stigma" attached to children's television.[32] After a supporting role in the football drama Remember the Titans, he secured a lead role as a young Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001's The Believer. Director Henry Bean said he cast Gosling because his Mormon upbringing helped him understand the isolation of Judaism.[33] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised an "electrifying and terrifyingly convincing" performance[34] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt his "dynamite performance" could "scarcely have been better".[35] The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival[36] and Gosling has described it as "the film that kind of gift-wrapped for me the career that I have now."[24] Because of the controversial nature of the film, it was difficult to secure financial backing for a full theatrical release,[37] and the film was instead broadcast on Showtime.[37] The film was a commercial failure, grossing $416,925 worldwide from a production budget of $1.5 million

            Following a three-year absence from the screen, Gosling starred in five films in 2010 and 2011. "I've never had more energy," Gosling said. "I'm more excited to make films than I used to be. I used to kind of dread it. It was so emotional and taxing. But I've found a way to have fun while doing it. And I think that translates into the films."[32] He has also spoken of feeling depressed when not working.[19] In 2010, he starred opposite Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, the marital drama Blue Valentine. The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said "you had to remind yourself you were making a film".[94] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he "brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance"[95] while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him to be "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version".[96] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that he "plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful."[97] However, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt the performance was an example of "hipsterism misdirected".[98] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Motion Picture Drama.[99] The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million.[100]
